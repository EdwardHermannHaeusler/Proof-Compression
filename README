* install python 2.7 and pip
since python 2 is deprecated new versions of pip will not use it. when
that happens, it's probably better to run this in a virtual
environment running an old version of a linux distro (like ubuntu
14.04 or debian oldstable)

* (optional) create virtual environment
: virtualenv -p python2 venv
: source venv/bin/active

* install dependencies
: pip install -r requirements.txt

* run
: python compress-hamiltonian-proof-graph.py
the input graph is included in the script, you can edit it there
